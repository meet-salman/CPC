# Way Too Long Words  
## ðŸ“š Description  
Sometimes, words like **localization** or **internationalization** are so long that repeating them multiple times becomes *tiresome*. To simplify, we can **abbreviate** such words using a specific rule.

A word is considered **too long** if its length is **strictly more than 10 characters**.

The abbreviation rule is:  
- Keep the **first** and **last** letters.  
- Replace the letters **in between** with the **count of those letters** in decimal form.

### ðŸ”¤ Examples:  
**localization** â†’ `l10n`  
**internationalization** â†’ `i18n`  

Words that are **not too long** remain **unchanged**.  

---

## ðŸ“¥ Input  
- The first line contains an integer `n` (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100) â€” the number of words.  
- Each of the next `n` lines contains one word.  
- All words consist of **lowercase Latin letters** and have lengths from **1 to 100** characters.  

---

## ðŸ“¤ Output  
- Print `n` lines.  
- Each line should contain the **abbreviated word** if the word is too long, or the **original word** if it is not.

## ðŸ’¡ Explanation  

**word** â†’ 4 characters â†’ not too long â†’ stays the same.  
**localization** â†’ first: `l`, last: `n`, 10 letters in between â†’ `l10n`  
**internationalization** â†’ first: `i`, last: `n`, 18 letters in between â†’ `i18n`  
**pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis** â†’ 45 characters â†’ `p43s`
